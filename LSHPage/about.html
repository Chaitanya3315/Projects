        <h1>OBJECTIVES</h1>
        <p>On a not-for-profit basis, the objectives of the LifeSpring Foundation are:
        </p>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>To sponsor poor women and children who cannot afford healthcare services and facilities rendered by healthcare service providers.</li>
            <li>To allow women to access the provision of free, high quality and dignified delivery.</li>
            <li>To utilize the funds and properties of the Society in the area of healthcare to elevate the lives of the economically backward, poor and deserving people at large</li>
            <li>To improve affordability of and access to quality healthcare by developing reduced cost structures, new pricing models, novel delivery systems, and public health communications technology.</li>
            <li>To undertake community outreach programmes by building partnerships or otherwise to target, educate, and influence adolescent girls and/or women</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The primary activity of LifeSpring Foundation is to administer its “Sponsoring Births Programme,” by which donors can sponsor the deliveries of women too poor to afford high quality maternal healthcare.  In the absence of such a fund to sponsor them, these women would either have a home delivery, deliver at an under-resourced public hospital, or deliver at a private hospital – often by selling their assets or by taking out high-interest loans to do so. 
        </p>

        <div class="works">

                    <p>1. Funds are raised through donors desirous of sponsoring the delivery of women too poor to afford high quality maternal health services.</p>

                    <p>2. Based on the amount of funds collected, community outreach workers go into urban slums and communities, and speak with pregnant women living below the poverty line and possessing a white card.  If these women have delivered before, their deliveries would have happened at a government hospital or at home.</p>
